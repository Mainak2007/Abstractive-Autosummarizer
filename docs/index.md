## Project Mission
In the present digital era, people ought to work with a huge volume of e-texts. Everything one needs to look at, from home to office, is in a digital mode. Going through a large volume of such texts is often tedious. Also, often we have to go through a lot of unnecessary documents, simply because we do not have an idea about each and everything that is contained in that document. One possible solution of such a problem is to have a summary, or, a synopsis of the text data we want to learn more about.  But, taking out a summary of a huge text manually is as inconvenient. 
Today, human beings possess one of the greatest tools that one could ever have - AI. The mission of the project has been to generate an AI-powered solution to the mentioned problem.
